Spence is a budget app that let users you open an account and aggregate all of your their data in one place at one time, so you always know how much money youâ€™re spending.


How Spence Works:

A user must open an account then log in to be able to go to their secure profile. From there, they will be able to add an expense like with an amount, category, currency (payment method), date of purchase and an optional note. After submitting, the user will be able to see a list of expenses that was posted in on the same page. They can also delete those expenses when they need. It's easy for a user to keep tracking of their spending with the Expense Breakdown section. This section tracks any new additions or deletions of expenses. The total updates in real-time, so any time an expense is added or removed, it's easy to see the current budget.


Tech Stack:

This application was created using React, Mongoose and MongoDB.
